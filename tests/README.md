# Test Architecture & CI Framework

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document serves as the definitive architectural guideline and detailed
documentation for the project's testing and Continuous Integration (CI)
framework. It is designed for both human developers and AI agents to gain a deep
understanding of our testing practices.

The primary purpose of this guide is to:

- Define our testing philosophy and strategy.
- Standardize the structure, location, and conventions for all test types.
- Detail the tools and frameworks used in our testing ecosystem.
- Explain the Continuous Integration (CI) process and how tests are executed and
  reported.
- Provide clear, actionable instructions for maintaining and expanding the test
  suite.

A robust testing framework is critical for ensuring code quality, stability, and
preventing regressions. It enables confident, rapid development and deployment
cycles. For our AI development assistants, this document is the foundational
knowledge base, enabling them to autonomously improve, expand, and maintain our
test suite and CI processes.

## 2. Testing Philosophy & Principles

Our testing strategy is guided by the following core principles:

- **Fast Feedback Loops:** Tests should run quickly, especially those executed
  frequently during development.
- **High Confidence on Critical Paths:** We prioritize comprehensive testing of
  core functionalities and critical user flows.
- **Adherence to the Testing Trophy Model:** We strive for a balanced portfolio
  of tests, with a strong base of unit tests, a healthy number of integration
  tests, and a select group of E2E tests for critical workflows.
- **Maintainability Over Sheer Coverage:** While we aim for high coverage, the
  clarity, readability, and maintainability of tests are paramount.
- **Reliability:** Tests must be deterministic and free of flakiness.
- **Shift-Left Testing:** We aim to catch issues as early as possible in the
  development lifecycle.

## 3. Test Types & Scope

### 3.1. Unit Tests

- **Definition:** Unit tests verify the functionality of individual, isolated
  units of code, such as functions, methods, or components. Their primary
  objective is to ensure that each unit of the software performs as designed.
- **Tools/Frameworks:** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- **Location:** `tests/unit/`
- **Conventions:**
  - **Naming:** `*.test.js`
  - **Mocking:** Mocks are located in `tests/mocks/`. Jest's built-in mocking
    features (`jest.mock`, `jest.spyOn`) are used extensively to isolate units
    under test.
- **AI Agent Guidance:**
  - Prioritize creating unit tests for all new functions and logic.
  - When fixing a bug, first write a failing unit test that reproduces the
    issue, then implement the fix.
  - Ensure all mocks are cleared between tests using `jest.clearAllMocks()`.

### 3.2. Integration Tests

- **Definition:** Integration tests verify that different modules or services
  used by the application work together as expected. These tests focus on the
  interactions between components.
- **Tools/Frameworks:** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- **Location:** `tests/integration/`
- **Conventions:**
  - **Naming:** `*.test.js`
  - **Environment:** These tests run in a Docker container with dependent
    services (like Redis) available.
- **AI Agent Guidance:**
  - Create integration tests for workflows that involve multiple internal
    modules (e.g., the command processor interacting with the Discord service).
  - Focus on testing the contracts and data flow between integrated parts.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Definition:** E2E tests simulate real user scenarios and verify that the
  entire application works as expected from start to finish. This includes the
  UI, backend services, and external integrations.
- **Tools/Frameworks:** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/),
  [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) (for browser interactions)
- **Location:** `tests/e2e/`
- **Conventions:**
  - **Naming:** `*.test.js`
  - **Configuration:** E2E tests use `jest.e2e.config.js`.
- **AI Agent Guidance:**
  - Add E2E tests for new critical user journeys.
  - When a bug is found in production, consider if an E2E test could have caught
    it.
  - Analyze flaky E2E tests and propose more robust solutions (e.g., improved
    waiting strategies, atomic assertions).

### 3.4. Performance Tests

- **Definition:** Performance tests measure the application's responsiveness,
  stability, and scalability under a given workload.
- **Tools/Frameworks:** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- **Location:** `tests/performance/`
- **Conventions:**
  - **Naming:** `*.test.js`
  - **Focus:** These tests are designed to benchmark critical operations and
    identify performance regressions.
- **AI Agent Guidance:**
  - Analyze the output of performance tests to identify bottlenecks.
  - Propose optimizations to the code or test environment to improve
    performance.

### 3.5. Security Tests

- **Definition:** Security tests are designed to uncover vulnerabilities in the
  application and ensure that it is robust against common threats.
- **Tools/Frameworks:** [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), `npm audit`
- **Location:** `tests/security/`
- **Conventions:**
  - **Naming:** `*.test.js`
  - **Configuration:** Security tests use `jest.security.config.js`.
  - **Focus:** Tests include input validation, dependency vulnerability checks,
    and checks for potential secret leaks.
- **AI Agent Guidance:**
  - Add new security tests for any new input processing logic.
  - Regularly check for and propose fixes for vulnerabilities reported by
    `npm audit`.

## 4.1. Test Configurations

The project includes multiple Jest configurations optimized for different
scenarios:

### Main Configuration (`jest.config.js`)

- **Production-ready configuration** with full coverage enforcement
- **Parallel execution** with 50% worker utilization
- **Caching enabled** for improved performance
- **Coverage thresholds enforced** for quality gates

### Development Configuration (`jest.dev.config.js`)

- **Optimized for fast feedback** during development
- **Single worker execution** for easier debugging
- **Bail on first failure** for immediate attention
- **Coverage disabled** for faster execution
- **Git-aware testing** (only changed files)

### Specialized Configurations

- **E2E Configuration (`jest.e2e.config.js`):** Extended timeouts, coverage
  disabled
- **Security Configuration (`jest.security.config.js`):** Security-focused test
  execution

## 4.2. Coverage Thresholds

The project enforces different coverage requirements based on component
criticality:

### Global Thresholds (Minimum)

```javascript
{
  statements: 25%,
  branches: 20%,
  functions: 25%,
  lines: 25%
}
```

### Core Modules (Higher Standards)

```javascript
'src/core/': {
  statements: 50%,
  branches: 40%,
  functions: 55%,
  lines: 50%
}
```

### Application Layer (High Standards)

```javascript
'src/application/bot-application.js': {
  statements: 85%,
  branches: 70%,
  functions: 80%,
  lines: 85%
},
'src/application/monitor-application.js': {
  statements: 85%,
  branches: 75%,
  functions: 85%,
  lines: 85%
},
'src/application/scraper-application.js': {
  statements: 75%,
  branches: 60%,
  functions: 80%,
  lines: 75%
}
```

### Critical Components (High Standards)

```javascript
'src/services/implementations/youtube-api-service.js': {
  statements: 90%,
  branches: 85%,
  functions: 90%,
  lines: 90%
},
'src/core/content-classifier.js': {
  statements: 85%,
  branches: 75%,
  functions: 90%,
  lines: 85%
}
```

These thresholds ensure code quality while being realistic and achievable.

## 5. Test Structure & Code Conventions

- **File Naming & Organization:** Test files are co-located in the `tests/`
  directory, under subdirectories corresponding to the test type.
- **Test Data Management:** Test data and fixtures are managed within the tests
  themselves or in the `tests/fixtures/` directory.
- **Mocking/Stubbing/Spying Strategy:** Jest's built-in functions (`jest.mock`,
  `jest.spyOn`, `jest.fn`) are the standard for creating test doubles.
- **Assertion Style:** The `expect` assertion style from Jest is used
  (`expect(value).toBe(expected)`).
- **Readability & Maintainability:** Tests should follow the
  **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern. Each test should have a single, clear
  responsibility.

## 5.1. Async Handling & Mock Implementation Best Practices

### Async Callback Testing

When testing code that uses `setImmediate` or other async callback mechanisms:

```javascript
// ✅ Correct: Wait for both promises and setImmediate callbacks
const flushPromises = async () => {
  await Promise.resolve();
  await new Promise(resolve => setImmediate(resolve));
};

// Usage in tests
it('should notify subscribers of state changes', async () => {
  stateManager.subscribe('key', mockCallback);
  stateManager.set('key', 'value');

  await flushPromises(); // Wait for async callbacks
  expect(mockCallback).toHaveBeenCalledWith('value', undefined, 'key');
});
```

### Proper Mock Setup

For classes with complex constructor behavior:

```javascript
// ✅ Correct: Use jest.spyOn for methods after instantiation
beforeEach(() => {
  const dependencies = {
    /* mock dependencies */
  };
  instance = new MyClass(dependencies);

  // Spy on methods that need mocking
  jest.spyOn(instance, 'methodName').mockResolvedValue(expectedValue);
});

// ❌ Incorrect: Don't use Class.mockImplementation in tests
// This won't work as expected
MyClass.mockImplementation(() => ({
  /* mock */
}));
```

### Timer Handling

When testing code with delays or timeouts:

```javascript
// ✅ Correct: Use async timer advancement
it('should handle delayed operations', async () => {
  jest.useFakeTimers();

  const promise = myFunction();
  await jest.runAllTimersAsync(); // Wait for timers AND promises

  const result = await promise;
  expect(result).toBe(expected);

  jest.useRealTimers();
});
```

### Error Log Silencing in Tests

The project uses global console mocking in `tests/setup.js` to prevent false
positive error logs during test execution. This ensures clean test output while
preserving the ability to test error handling behavior.

#### ✅ **Automatic Console Silencing**

All `console.error`, `console.warn`, `console.log`, and `console.info` calls are
automatically mocked in the test environment:

```javascript
// These are automatically silenced in tests
console.error('This error message will not appear in test output');
console.warn('This warning will not appear in test output');
```

#### ✅ **Testing Error Handling Without Log Noise**

When testing error scenarios, focus on the error handling logic rather than
logging:

```javascript
// ✅ Good: Test validates error handling without generating log noise
describe('Error Handling', () => {
  it('should handle API failures gracefully', async () => {
    mockApiService.getData.mockRejectedValue(new Error('API Error'));

    const result = await service.fetchData();

    // Focus on the error handling outcome, not logging
    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toBe('API Error');
  });
});
```

#### ✅ **When Testing Error Logging Behavior is Required**

For tests that specifically validate logging behavior, use explicit console
spies:

```javascript
// ✅ Good: For tests that specifically validate error logging behavior
it('should log critical errors to console', async () => {
  const consoleErrorSpy = jest
    .spyOn(console, 'error')
    .mockImplementation(() => {});

  await service.handleCriticalError(new Error('Critical failure'));

  expect(consoleErrorSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.stringContaining('Critical error:'),
    expect.any(Error)
  );

  consoleErrorSpy.mockRestore();
});
```

#### ❌ **Avoid Adding Console Calls in Test Mocks**

Don't add console.error calls in test mock implementations as they create noise:

```javascript
// ❌ Avoid: This creates false positive error logs
const mockHandler = async data => {
  try {
    return await processData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Processing failed:', error.message); // Creates noise!
    throw error;
  }
};

// ✅ Better: Silent error handling in test mocks
const mockHandler = async data => {
  try {
    return await processData(data);
  } catch (error) {
    // Silenced in tests - error is re-thrown for Jest to handle
    throw error;
  }
};
```

#### **Global Test Setup Benefits**

- **Clean Output:** No false positive error logs cluttering test results
- **Test Integrity:** Tests that validate logging behavior still work correctly
- **Debugging Support:** Access to original console via `global.originalConsole`
  when needed
- **Unhandled Rejection Silence:** Unhandled rejections are silenced in test
  environment

#### **Debugging When Needed**

If you need to see actual console output during debugging:

```javascript
// Use original console for debugging
global.originalConsole.error('This will actually appear in output');

// Or temporarily restore console for a test
beforeEach(() => {
  console.error = global.originalConsole.error; // Restore for debugging
});
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don't** use duplicate `beforeEach` blocks - this causes test interference
- **Don't** mock class constructors directly in test files
- **Don't** forget to wait for `setImmediate` callbacks in async tests
- **Don't** add console.error calls in test mock implementations (creates false
  positives)
- **Do** use `jest.clearAllMocks()` in `beforeEach` to ensure clean test state
- **Do** restore timers with `jest.useRealTimers()` after fake timer tests
- **Do** focus on error handling outcomes rather than logging in most tests

  chosen based on the nature of the change.
- **Updating Existing Tests:** When refactoring or modifying code, the
  corresponding tests must be updated to reflect the changes.
- **Coverage Requirements:** New code must meet the established coverage
  thresholds for its component type.
- **Performance Considerations:** Tests should execute efficiently and use
  appropriate configurations for their purpose.

### AI Agent Specific Directives:

- **Coverage Improvement:** Proactively identify critical modules with low test
  coverage and generate new tests to cover untested logic.
- **Flakiness Detection & Resolution:** Analyze test results to identify flaky
  tests and propose deterministic fixes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Analyze test runtimes and suggest optimizations
  using the available performance configurations.
- **CI Optimization:** Propose improvements to the GitHub Actions workflow
  (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) for speed, efficiency, or robustness.
- **Code Generation:** Generate new test files and test cases, strictly adhering
  to the conventions defined in this document.
- **Configuration Management:** Utilize appropriate Jest configurations (main,
  dev, e2e, security) based on the testing context.
- **Coverage Threshold Compliance:** Ensure all new code meets or exceeds the
  established coverage thresholds for its component type.

### Enhanced Testing Workflows:

- **CI/CD:** Employ full configuration with coverage enforcement and quality
  gates

## 10. Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### 10.1. Common Error Patterns

- **`Module not found`:** This usually indicates a problem with module mocking
  or a missing dependency. Verify that `jest.mock` is used correctly or run
  `npm install`.
- **Timeout Errors:** In E2E or integration tests, this can indicate a slow
  response from an external service or a flaw in the test's waiting mechanism.
- **Flaky E2E Tests:** Often caused by race conditions or timing issues.
  Investigate the test flow and add more robust waiting mechanisms (e.g.,
  `waitForSelector` instead of fixed delays).
- **Coverage Threshold Failures:** Tests fail due to insufficient coverage.
  Check which files/functions need additional test coverage.

### 10.2. Performance Issues

- **Slow Test Execution:**
  - Use `npm run test:parallel` for faster execution
  - Switch to `npm run test:dev` for development
  - Utilize `npm run test:changed` for git-aware testing
- **Memory Issues:** Large test suites may consume significant memory. Use
  `forceExit: true` and `detectOpenHandles: true` in Jest config.
- **Cache Issues:** Clear Jest cache with `rm -rf .jest-cache` if experiencing
  unexpected behavior.

### 10.3. Configuration Issues

- **Wrong Configuration Loading:** Ensure you're using the correct Jest config
  file for your use case:
  - `jest.config.js` - Production/CI
  - `jest.dev.config.js` - Development
  - `jest.e2e.config.js` - End-to-end tests
  - `jest.security.config.js` - Security tests

## 11. Future Enhancements & Roadmap

- **Mutation Testing:** Explore integrating a mutation testing framework to
  assess the quality of our tests.
- **Contract Testing:** For services we don't own, introduce contract testing to
  ensure our integrations remain valid.
- **Expand Performance Testing:** Broaden the scope of performance tests to
  cover more application scenarios.
- **Visual Regression Testing:** Add visual testing capabilities for UI
  components.
- **Test Analytics:** Implement test execution analytics and reporting
  dashboard.
