● Test Failures Todo List

  High Priority Issues

  1. BotApplication Logger Mock Issue ⚠️

  - Error: Tests expect regular logger but getting EnhancedLogger
  instance
  - Location: tests/unit/bot-application.test.js:181
  - Details: Mock setup returns EnhancedLogger wrapper instead of
  base logger object
  - Impact: Multiple BotApplication constructor and method tests
  failing

  2. BotApplication Enhanced Logger Format Mismatch ⚠️

  - Error: Tests expect old log format but getting structured
  logging with timestamps/modules
  - Location: tests/unit/bot-application.test.js (multiple
  assertions)
  - Details: Enhanced logging adds metadata that breaks existing
  test expectations
  - Impact: All logging assertion tests in BotApplication suite
  failing

  3. MonitorApplication Missing startOperation Method ⚠️

  - Error: TypeError: this.logger.startOperation is not a function
  - Location: src/application/monitor-application.js:735
  - Details: Code expects enhanced logger with startOperation but
  tests provide basic mock
  - Impact: All YouTube processing tests in
  announcement-debug-scenarios failing

  Medium Priority Issues

  4. Integration Test Mock Method Not Called

  - Error: mockContentClassifier.classifyYouTubeContent not being
  called as expected
  - Location:
  tests/integration/monitor-application-fallback.test.js:432
  - Details: Content classification integration not working in
  fallback workflow
  - Impact: Content classification test failing

  5. Missing Event Emission in Fallback Test

  - Error: monitor.video.processed event not being emitted
  - Location:
  tests/integration/monitor-application-fallback.test.js:464
  - Details: Event bus mock not receiving expected video processed
   event
  - Impact: Event workflow verification failing

  6. YouTube Debug Scenarios All Failing

  - Error: Same startOperation method error across all YouTube
  test scenarios
  - Location: tests/debug/announcement-debug-scenarios.test.js
  - Details: 4 out of 8 debug scenarios failing due to logger
  method issue
  - Impact: YouTube content debugging functionality not testable

  Low Priority Issues

  7. Test Coverage Below Thresholds

  - Error: Global coverage at 6.84% (need 20%), src/core at 0%
  (need 40%)
  - Details: Coverage failing due to test execution issues, not
  actual missing tests
  - Impact: CI/CD quality gates failing, but underlying issue is
  test execution

  ---
  Root Cause Analysis: The main issue appears to be a mismatch
  between the enhanced logging system implementation and test
  mocks. Tests were written for basic logging but the codebase now
   uses EnhancedLogger with additional methods like
  startOperation.
