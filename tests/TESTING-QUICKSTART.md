# 🧪 Testing Quick Start Guide

## ⚡ Fast Development Commands

```bash
# Start here - Development optimized testing
npm run test:dev           # Fast feedback, single worker, bail on first failure

# Watch mode for continuous development
npm run test:watch         # Auto-run tests on file changes

# Only test what you've changed
npm run test:changed       # Git-aware testing

# Full test suite when you're ready
npm test                   # All tests with coverage
```

## 🎯 Testing Specific Components

```bash
# Target specific test types
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e           # End-to-end tests

# Test specific files/patterns
npm run test:file -- command-processor
npm run test:file -- fallback
```

## 🚀 Performance & Debugging

```bash
# Faster execution
npm run test:parallel      # 50% worker utilization

# Debug failing tests
npm run test:debug         # Debug mode with breakpoints
npm run test:verbose       # Detailed output

# Interactive test runner
npm run test:runner unit   # Enhanced CLI with colors
npm run test:runner coverage --verbose
```

## 📊 Coverage & Quality

```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage      # Creates coverage/ directory

# Check coverage thresholds
# Global: 25% statements/lines, 20% branches, 25% functions
# Core modules: 50% statements/lines, 40% branches, 55% functions
# Critical components: 85-90% coverage
```

## 🔧 Configuration Files

- **`jest.config.js`** - Production config with full coverage enforcement
- **`jest.dev.config.js`** - Development config for fast feedback
- **`jest.e2e.config.js`** - End-to-end test configuration
- **`jest.security.config.js`** - Security test configuration

## 🛠️ Common Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start development with fast feedback
npm run test:dev -- --watch

# 2. Run specific test types as you work
npm run test:unit -- your-component

# 3. Before committing, run all tests
npm test

# 4. Debug if needed
npm run test:debug -- failing-test
```

## ✅ Coverage Requirements

| Component Type          | Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines  |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| **Global**              | 25%        | 20%      | 25%       | 25%    |
| **Core Modules**        | 50%        | 40%      | 55%       | 50%    |
| **Critical Components** | 85-90%     | 75-85%   | 90%       | 85-90% |

## 🎨 Interactive Test Runner

```bash
# Launch the enhanced test runner
npm run test:runner --help

# Examples
npm run test:runner unit              # Run unit tests
npm run test:runner coverage          # Generate coverage
npm run test:runner watch --bail      # Watch mode with fail-fast
npm run test:runner dev               # Development mode
```
