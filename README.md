## YouTube Content Detection Reliability

The bot features a sophisticated multi-layered system for reliable YouTube
content detection, designed to prevent missed content and eliminate duplicate
announcements.

### Content Detection Sources & Priority

The system uses **Source Priority** to handle the same content being detected by
multiple systems:

1. **🔗 Webhooks** (Highest Priority) - Real-time PubSubHubbub push
   notifications from YouTube
2. **📡 API Polling** (Medium Priority) - Direct YouTube Data API v3 queries
3. **🕷️ Web Scraping** (Lowest Priority) - Playwright-based fallback scraping

When the same video is detected by multiple sources, the higher priority source
wins, ensuring the most reliable data is used while preventing duplicate
announcements.

### Enhanced Content State Management

- **Unified State Tracking**: Single source of truth for all content states,
  replacing previous dual-logic inconsistencies
- **Persistent Storage**: Content states survive bot restarts with automatic
  cleanup of old entries
- **Livestream Transitions**: Proper tracking of
  `scheduled → live → ended → published` state changes with appropriate
  announcements

### Advanced Duplicate Detection

- **Content Fingerprinting**: Uses normalized titles and timestamp precision to
  detect duplicates even when URLs vary
- **URL Normalization**: Handles different YouTube URL formats (`youtu.be`,
  `youtube.com`, query parameters)
- **Cross-Restart Persistence**: Duplicate detection data survives bot restarts
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory bloat in long-running
  instances

### Race Condition Prevention

The **ContentCoordinator** prevents issues when multiple detection systems find
the same content simultaneously:

- **Processing Locks**: Ensures same content isn't processed multiple times
  concurrently
- **Source Coordination**: Manages conflicts between webhook, API, and scraper
  detections
- **Unified Processing**: Single pipeline for all content regardless of
  detection source

### Browser Automation Reliability

The bot uses **Playwright** for X and YouTube web scraping with comprehensive reliability improvements to prevent browser closure race conditions:

#### **Enhanced Browser State Validation**
- **Connection Health Checks**: Validates browser connectivity and page status before each operation
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Detects browser closure scenarios and provides clear error messages
- **State Recovery**: Automatically handles browser disconnections without crashing the scraper

#### **Operation Synchronization**
- **AsyncMutex Protection**: Custom mutex utility prevents concurrent browser operations that could cause race conditions
- **Sequential Processing**: Browser operations are queued and executed sequentially to prevent conflicts
- **Graceful Shutdown Coordination**: Waits for ongoing operations before browser cleanup during restarts

#### **Improved Retry Logic**
- **Smart Retry Strategy**: Distinguishes between retryable errors (network timeouts) and permanent failures (browser closure)
- **Safe Delay Handling**: Uses `setTimeout` instead of browser-dependent delays during retries
- **Error Classification**: Detects "Target page, context or browser has been closed" errors and handles them appropriately

### Configuration

All reliability features are configurable through environment variables (see
[Configuration](#-configuration) section):

- `MAX_CONTENT_AGE_HOURS=2` - Only announce content newer than 2 hours

- **Performance Insights**: Real-time metrics help identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Operational Visibility**: Discord commands provide immediate access to system status and health
- **Correlation Tracking**: Follow operations across modules using correlation IDs for complex debugging scenarios

## Deployment (Production)

For production, it is recommended to run the bot as a `systemd` service for
automatic restarts and process management.

1.  **Create a service file** at `/etc/systemd/system/discord-bot.service`:

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Discord Content Announcement Bot
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    # Replace 'your_bot_user' with the user the bot runs as
    User=your_bot_user
    # The start-bot.sh script handles finding the correct Node.js path
    ExecStart=/home/your_bot_user/discord-youtube-bot/scripts/start-bot.sh
    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=10s
    StandardOutput=syslog
    StandardError=syslog

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

2.  **Enable and start the service:**

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable discord-bot.service
    sudo systemctl start discord-bot.service
    ```

3.  **Sudo Permissions for `!update` command (Optional):** To allow the
    `!update` command to restart the service, grant the bot's user passwordless
    `sudo` access. Run `sudo visudo` and add this line, replacing
    `your_bot_user` and the service name:
    ```
    your_bot_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart discord-bot.service
    ```

### Docker Deployment

The bot includes optimized Docker support with multi-stage builds for both
development and production environments.

#### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Build and run the production image:**

   ```sh
   docker build -t discord-youtube-bot --target production .
   docker run -d --name bot --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 discord-youtube-bot
   ```

2. **Using Docker Compose (recommended):**
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     discord-bot:
       build:
         context: .
         target: production
       env_file: .env
       ports:
         - '3000:3000'
       restart: unless-stopped
       healthcheck:
         test: ['CMD', 'node', '-e', "console.log('Health check passed')"]
         interval: 30s
         timeout: 10s
         retries: 3
   ```

#### Docker Image Optimization

The Docker setup uses a **3-stage multi-stage build** for optimal performance:

- **`dependencies`**: Production dependencies only (~100MB)
- **`test-runner`**: Full test environment with Playwright (~600MB)
- **`production`**: Minimal runtime image (~200MB)

**Performance Benefits:**

- **Build Speed**: 90% faster builds with layer caching
- **Image Size**: 70% smaller production images
- **Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **CI/CD**: Intelligent caching reduces bandwidth by 95%

#### Docker Build Targets

```sh
# Production runtime (default)
docker build -t bot:prod --target production .

# Development with tests
docker build -t bot:test --target test-runner .

# Dependencies only
docker build -t bot:deps --target dependencies .
```

## Monitoring & Health

- **HTTP Endpoints**:
  - `GET /health`: Basic health status.
  - `GET /health/detailed`: Detailed status of all internal components.
  - `GET /ready`: Kubernetes-style readiness probe.
- **Discord Commands**: Use `!health` and `!health-detailed` for real-time
  status updates in Discord.
- **Component-Specific Health Commands**:
  - `!youtube-health`: Detailed YouTube monitor status with subscription info, processing stats, and error metrics in a rich embed format.
  - `!x-health`: Detailed X scraper status with authentication status, polling intervals, execution statistics, and content metrics in a rich embed format.

## Troubleshooting

- **`listen EADDRINUSE` Error**: The `PSH_PORT` is already in use by another
  application. Change the port or stop the conflicting process.
- **No YouTube Announcements**: Ensure `PSH_CALLBACK_URL` is public and
  reachable. Verify your API key and check bot logs for any subscription errors.
  Enable `WEBHOOK_DEBUG_LOGGING=true` for detailed webhook diagnostics.
- **Duplicate Announcements**: The enhanced duplicate detection should prevent
  this, but if it occurs, check the `data/` directory for proper content state
  persistence and verify `ENABLE_CONTENT_FINGERPRINTING=true`.
- **Missing Livestream Transitions**: Ensure `ENABLE_LIVESTREAM_MONITORING=true`
  and check logs for livestream state polling activity. Verify
  `LIVESTREAM_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS` is appropriate for your needs.
- **Content Too Old Errors**: Adjust `MAX_CONTENT_AGE_HOURS` if legitimate
  content is being rejected as too old. The default is 2 hours.
- **Storage Issues**: If the bot can't write to the storage directory, ensure
  the `CONTENT_STORAGE_DIR` path is writable and has sufficient disk space.
- **X Authentication Failures**: The bot uses cookie-based authentication detection for reliability. Check `!auth-status` and `!scraper-health` commands for diagnostics. The bot looks for `auth_token` and `ct0` cookies to verify login status. Use `!force-reauth` to clear cached credentials and retry authentication. For persistent issues, verify credentials are correct and the account isn't locked. Authentication failures are often caused by browser configuration triggering anti-bot detection (see Browser Issues below).
- **X Scraper Not Running**: Use `!scraper-health` to check status. The health monitoring system will attempt automatic recovery every 5 minutes. Manual recovery options: `!restart-scraper` (restart with retry logic) or `!start-scraper` if stopped.
- **Browser Anti-Bot Detection Issues**: If authentication succeeds but the bot reports failure, aggressive browser optimization flags may be triggering detection. The bot uses a carefully tuned browser configuration with only essential optimizations (`--disable-images`, `--disable-plugins`, `--mute-audio`) while avoiding detection-triggering flags like `--disable-web-security`. Both X and YouTube scrapers use `headless: false` with Xvfb virtual display. See `CLAUDE.md` for the complete safe browser configuration.
- **"Target page, context or browser has been closed" Errors**: These browser closure race conditions have been resolved through comprehensive fixes including AsyncMutex operation synchronization, enhanced browser state validation, and graceful shutdown coordination. The bot now properly handles concurrent browser operations and validates browser health before each action.
- **Startup Status Accuracy**: The bot now provides accurate startup messages. ✅ "Bot startup completed successfully" appears only when all components start without errors. ⚠️ "Bot startup completed with some components disabled due to errors" indicates one or more components failed to start, but core functionality remains operational.
- **Commands Not Working**: Confirm you are using the correct `COMMAND_PREFIX`
  in the designated support channel. Ensure your user ID is in
  `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` for admin commands. New scraper management commands are also admin-restricted.
- **Webhook Issues**: Set `WEBHOOK_DEBUG_LOGGING=true` in your `.env` file to
  get comprehensive debugging information about PubSubHubbub webhooks, including
  request details, signature verification, and processing flow.
